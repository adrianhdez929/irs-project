    "description": "Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action. In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again. Play with all major updates since launch: Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation and the 3.0 update, ORIGINS, Next Generation, Companions, Expeditions, Prisms, Frontiers, Sentinel, Outlaws, Endurance, Waypoint (4.0), Fractal, Interceptor, Echoes, Omega, Orbital and Worlds Part I (5.0). Available for PC and Mac (see recommended and minimum specs for details). An epic voyage to the centre of a shared universe awaits, allowing you to explore, trade, fight and survive alone or with friends. At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit. Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry. Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards. Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary. The galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as well as your own..."

In battle, Zetterburn uses no weapons except for his razor-sharp claws and ability to control flame.   BURN DAMAGE - Zetterburn's special attacks can set opponents on fire, causing them additional damage over time.   WILD FIRE - Zetterburn's Down Special places flames on the stage. These flames stay for a period of time, burning any opponents who come in contact with them.   FIRE AMP - When an opponent is burning, Zetterburn's Strong Attacks can absorb the flames and launch the burned enemy twice as far, making for an effective killing blow. Orcane is a playful trickster, notorious for escaping even the most precarious of situations. He can transform into water and confuse enemies with a spray of bubbles.   PUDDLE TELEPORTATION - Orcane creates a puddle with his Neutral Special or Down Special. He can then teleport to his puddle using his Up Special as a powerful vertical blow or an effective recovery when launched off the stage.   BUBBLE EVAPORATION - Orcane can turn his puddle into a pillar of bubbles with his Down Special to trap enemies above the puddle.   WATER AMP - When standing on top of his puddle, Orcane can consume the water underneath him to perform powerful Strong Attacks with far greater range and knockback. The youngest trainee in the history of the Air Academy, Wrastor has never lived by anyone's rules but his own. Currently an Aerial Ace for the Air Armada, Wrastor is wrecking havoc among the Armada's enemies and generals alike.   WINGED FLIGHT - Wrastor can jump 4 times, making him incredible at controlling the air and recovering from the toughest falls even when things look grim.   WIND CURRENT - Wrastor can create a Wind Current with his Forward Special, allowing him to move faster within it and chase his targets more effectively.   AERIAL ACE - Wrastor performs his charged Strong Attacks in the air instead of on the ground, a first for this genre. Kragg is a defender of the colossal Aetherian Forest. Deliberate and loyal, he is one of the infamous Wall Runners who patrol the Rock Wall. Unlike other Wall Runners, Kragg has the legendary ability to control the earth with his will.   ROCK HURL - Kragg can pull a rock out of the ground and hurl it at opponents. After it leaves his hands, the rock becomes a solid piece of stage that either Kragg or other players can break.   DEFENSE BALL - Kragg can curl into a ball and roll toward enemies. Although he can be damaged while in ball form, he cannot be knocked away.   EARTH PILLAR - Kragg can summon a pillar of earth to his feet regardless of where he is. If Kragg is about to fall to his death, this move can quickly turn his situation around. Forsburn is the disgraced, eldest son of the Firelands' ruling family. After being condemned by the Fire Council and his own brother, Forsburn found refuge in a group of outsiders who had rejected the flame and mastered the way of smoke.   SMOKE SCREEN - Forsburn can use his Neutral Special to obscure the battlefield allowing Forsburn to remain hidden inside a cloud of smoke.   DECOY - Through his Forward Special, Forsburn can create a smoke facsimile of himself that can attack opponents. The illusory Forsburn breaks into smoke after being hit by a single attack.   CONSUME/COMBUST - By using his Down Special, Forsburn can consume his smoke clouds back into his body. After consuming three clouds, Forsburn is charged up and can use Down Special again to combust: knocking opponents away at high speed. Maypul is the self-appointed Guardian of the Aetherian Forest. She commands fearful respect throughout the forest for her unhesitating vigilantism. She uses her agility to trap any unknown intruders before they even realize she is there.   WATCHER'S MARK - Maypul can use her Seeds or her Watcher's Dash to mark opponents, making them susceptible to her following attacks.   WRAPPED UP - After marking her targets, Maypul can use her Strong Attacks or her trusty Plant to wrap marked opponents in place allowing her to follow up with another attack.   SLING SHOT - Maypul can use her vines to sling toward marked opponents, allowing her to elude attacks and quickly close distances. Absa is a famed engineer and martialist of the Elders of the Air Alliance. Despite the laws of the Elders, Absa secretly developed storm techniques in the caves of the Archai mountains.   CLOUD CONTROL - Absa can place a cloud using her Neutral or Forward Special. This cloud hangs in the air until Absa bursts it by tapping her Neutral Special and knocking enemies away.   THUNDER BOLT - Absa can charge her Neutral Special to create a powerful lightning blast that connects her to her cloud. All opponents caught between the two will be knocked away at high speeds.   CONDENSED STORM - Absa focuses the power of a lightning bolt to the tip of her hoof. If she can line up one of her aerial kicks perfectly, she unleashes great power. Etalus is a legendary warrior in his native land. He is one of the last surviving members of the Harbor Guard and uses the power of ice to augment his massive strength.   HOME ICE ADVANTAGE: Etalus can use his Forward Special or Forward Tilt to freeze the ground beneath him in order to slide across on the icy surface.   ARMORED UP: When standing on ice, Etalus can use his Neutral Special to absorb the ice and create ice armor around his body.   AVALANCHE: Etalus can use his Down Special to shatter all nearby ice, instantly freezing any enemies who are standing on it. Ranno was known as be a feared martial artist who trained under wise monks. But now he prefers to peacefully protect his swampy homeland. When he has no other option, you can see glimpses of his rapid and deliberate strikes.  POISON STACKS - Ranno\u2019s Specials Strong Attacks and Jab Combo apply up to four poisonous stacks on his opponents. These stacks damage opponents when they attack and can be removed by hitting Ranno.  TOXIC TRAP - Ranno\u2019s Neutral Special and Down Special can place his opponents in a Toxic Bubble Trap that makes it easier for Ranno to combo. The length of time in the trap depends on the number of Poison Stacks on the opponent.  POISON SPIN - Ranno\u2019s recovery onto stage has three options. He begins it with a Poison Lunge that is quick and knocks opponents away. After the lunge he can quickly Poison Kick down onto the stage with another quick strike. Or he can use the Posion Spin to fire out an array of Posion Darts in many directions.  Clairen is a seasoned warrior from a distant future where the heroes of flame vanish and never return. After being defeated by a tyrannical and ever-living emperor, she travels back in time in order to defeat him.  IONIZED TIP - Unlike the other soldiers from the future, Clairen manipulates her blade to be two-toned. The end of Clairen's sword is super-charged, allowing her to stun enemies who are hit precisely with the tip.   PLASMA ECHO - Clairen dashes forward with her Side Special to quickly escape. The deadly plasma resonance left behind can damage enemies and even KO opponents with its sweet spot.  ENERGY FIELD - Performing a Down Special right before an attack hits Clairen will trigger her energy field. This field damages and pushes other Rivals away while nullifying all projectiles that try to enter it. Sylvanos is the heart of the Aetherian Forest. A rageful deity, Sylvanos has only a single goal - to expand the forest over all of Aether. Unfortunately, the great Rock Wall traps the spirit as he patrols the forest\u2019s floor. Sylvanos leads the plant life in the forest looking for ways to expand his dominance.  UNTAMED GROWTH - Sylvanos spreads grass as he runs around. The grass leaves if Sylvanos is away from it for too long. Sylvanos can use Down Special to call Plants Rise and damage any opponents standing on grass.  SEED SHOT - Sylvanos\u2019 Neutral Special fires a deadly seed into the air. If it hits an opponent it will lock them in place, but if it reaches the ground then it will plant a flower that maintains a permanent fixture of grass on that ground or platform until it is destroyed.  BURROW - Sylvanos can dig into solid ground and reappear by digging out from a different position. If he digs under grass he can pop out with a strong bite attack to KO enemies off the top of the screen. Elliana is a snake from the burrows in the Eastern Wastelands who has always dreamt of flying. After her dreams of joining the Air Armada were crushed by an intolerant captain, she sought the aid of Ayala, a brilliant engineer. Together they built a steam-powered flying machine and with it, Elliana now plans to destroy the armada that rejected her.  OVERHEAT - Elliana\u2019s ship heats up when she uses specials or her unique double jump that allows her to hover. Once overheated she can no longer use her specials or hover, becoming more vulnerable to her enemies.  LETTING OFF STEAM - Elliana can perform Strong Attacks to expel steam away from her ship, lowering her Overheat bar. The steam can also catch opponents or be blown away by attacks. When she is overheated, her strong attacks let off a powerful explosion instead that can KO opponents.  ABANDON SHIP - Elliana can use her Up Special to abandon ship even when overheated. She launches herself high into the air and her ship explodes. Be careful, as she is very vulnerable while outside of her ship and she must rebuild it upon landing on the ground. Ori and Sein are from the hit indie game  Ori and the Blind Forest  and they bring their skills to the test in Rivals of Aether. While Ori works to Bash, Stomp and Glide his way to victory, Sein can use the Spirit Flame or the Charged Flame to put enemies between a rock and a hard place.  SPIRIT FLAME \u2013 Sein follows Ori around the battlefield. Ori can tap Neutral Special to have Sein quickly fire a Spirit Flame from wherever Sein is. Ori can hold Neutral Special to have Sein use the Charged Flame.  BASH \u2013 Ori can use Down Special to Bash nearly anything in Rivals of Aether \u2013 from characters to projectiles to rocks and plants. Ori can also move around the stage by bashing the Light Grenade that is thrown by using Forward Special.  TAG TEAM \u2013 When Ori and Sein are close enough, Ori can use Strong Attacks to initiate tag team combos. These Strong Attacks have more powerful properties as Sein assists Ori for a more devastating blow. Shovel Knight has learned a lot during  Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove  and he brings those skills with him to Rivals of Aether. Shovel Knight swings, digs and shovel drops his way through the Rivals roster. He does it all while collecting treasure which he can use to purchase upgrades to give him the upper hand on the battlefield.  TREASURE HUNTER \u2013 Shovel Knight\u2019s attacks knock coins and gems out of his opponents. He can collect these to increase his treasure. By taunting, he summons Chester and can use his treasure to purchase either Relics or Armors to improve his fighting ability.  SHOVEL DROP \u2013 Shovel Knight\u2019s signature ability is his Down Air in Rivals of Aether. With this attack he can strike his opponents from above and bounce off their heads. Hold the attack button to keep the Shovel beneath him. He can also bounce off objects and projectiles!  EXPERT FISHERMAN \u2013 Shovel Knight\u2019s down special is the Fishing Rod. Use it off the side of the stage to fish up some treasure. Time it correctly and fish up a Treasure Rock, but time it perfectly and get a Golden Fish. "

    "description": "Death Is Not an Escape. Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at http://www.deadbydaylight.com Key Features \u2022  Survive Together\u2026 Or Not  - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? \u2022  Where Am I?  - Each level is procedurally generated, so you\u2019ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. \u2022  A Feast for Killers  - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer\u2019s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. \u2022  Deeper and Deeper  - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. \u2022  Real People, Real Fear  - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it\u2019s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what\u2019s hiding in the fog.  WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING  A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns.

    "description": "RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller.  Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.  You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.  Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.  Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.  Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.  Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.  Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.  Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.  Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.  Trade with passing ships and caravans.  Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.  Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.  Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.  Discover a new generated world each time you play.  Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.  Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.  RimWorld is a story generator.  It\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \u201crandom\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the  AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.  Your colonists are not professional settlers  \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.  Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.  A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.  Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.  Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.  The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.  You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.  Travel across the planet.  You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.  You can tame and train animals.  Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.  People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.  They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.  Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.  Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.  You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.  A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at http://rimworldgame.com. (All non-English translations are made by fans.)"

    "description": "Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave\u2026 but will you be the same? SYNOPSIS Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit. SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP You\u2019re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players. Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial. Whatever the number of players in your party, it\u2019s about surviving and getting out. Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map. HIDE OR FLIGHT In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them. The tools will allow you to   Stun enemies  Blind them  See through walls  Heal yourself and people around you. Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges. Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Customize and create your own trial patient. Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish. Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle.  Meet the Denizens of Murkoff\u2019s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials. Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you\u2019ll make it?  INVESTIGATE You\u2019ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials.  Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff\u2019s malpractice against its patients. The Process:  Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject\u2019s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.  Build the Self: It\u2019s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement. This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.  Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology. This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.  Content and Photosensitivity Warning: The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images. This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy."

To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined.

Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information.  Slinger The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale. From diversion tactics to creating shortcuts, the Slinger has a variety of uses, and allows you to hunt in new and interesting ways.

    "description": "FOREWORD  PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING Neckbreak is  not  a boomer shooter. Check the demo to see how the action plays and flows or check the games Discord which is full of clips with insane combos and cool encounters sent in by the community.  BACKGROUND The world we have known is coming to an end. The European Union is in disarray, with a new superpower emerging on the horizon: The Novorussian Federation, which already welcomed new members such as Lithuania, Ukraine and Poland.  Enter the first mega-city of Europe: Crimson Tide. The free city of Crimson Tide(the representative free city of this New World Order, showing that both systems can co-exist in harmony, forging a better future for its citizens) was raised as the representative pinnacle of humanity's achievements on the border of Germany and Poland, in agreement to respect the sovereignty of both the EU/Transatlantic States and Novorussian Federation. But, as history has taught us, this is true only in theory.... Governing parties are not political but rather economical, pointing to a new direction of leading nations. Gone are the days of political parties, replaced by voting with your wallet for the corporate entity which provides everyday life with the highest benefits. Leading corporate entities deal most of the cards, keeping its citizens in check with mandatory medication. Somewhere in the city, in the Lakk District, a regular middle class citizen is about to start another routine day\u2026   THE GAME  An overdose of reality can have dire consequences... Neckbreak is a pill poppin' first person adventure with semi-tactical in your face combat and unique perks and quirks.  You start in your apartment getting ready for another routine day at the office and your adventure starts from there. The storyline will progress with completion of main missions and branch out depending on various factors (chosen path, mental state, specific choice/interaction/pickup/etc).  You are a regular, middle class citizen. By day, leading your ordinary, rinse-repeat corpo-routine life, with your lovely girlfriend Olga by your side, a well paid job and crib with an amazing view. What more could a guy want?  Yet you feel privileged and as a true socialist you feel you need to give something back\u2026 ...By night, you give your contribution to society as a self-proclaimed dealer of justice, dispatching all sorts of scum with extreme prejudice\u2026 Or, at least that is what you think...  What to expect (Early Access):  THE SUPERKICK  Unique blend of action and adventure, where you are given the freedom to discover the plot at your own pace(or not) and come to your own conclusions.  A unorthodox semi-tactical shooter with superpowers, where reflexes, environmental awareness and quick thinking count. Encounters play more like fast paced puzzles with lethal consequences. Both you and the enemies go down real fast. You'll need to make best use of the games unique combat mechanics (such as the pills, superkick, slammer, adrenline slide/jump and more) for the most stylish and fun outcomes.  A dynamic and fitting Original Soundtrack which adapts to what's going on on-screen  Non linear progression. Certain scenes will play out differently depending on your choices and state of mind, or maybe even will reveal alternate levels, routes to your goal  Cannon fodder  Trippy visuals  Sanity system. The world will react to the players self-medication threshold in varied ways throughout the games timeline.  No health regen  Actually no way of replenishing your health at all  Lots of alternative events, possibilities, routes and more, leading you to one of the 12 endings.  Combo kill and style system  The Superkick  lots of fun ways of dispatching your foes  Leaderboards  Freeroam hub which expands with the games timeline offering new opportunities  "

    "description": "Tactical, beautiful, and wholly unique, the GOTY-winning sci-fi RTS returns with Homeworld 3. Assume control and battle through fleet combat in dazzling, fully 3D space while the award-winning story unfolds on a galactic scale. Strategic freedom is yours. Hulking space derelicts called megaliths bring 3D terrain into the classic Homeworld battlespace. Use the crumbling remains of an ancient civilization to funnel foes into a brilliant ambush or hide your fleet from powerful enemies. Fortresses teem with menacing turrets and invite your strike craft into dangerous trench runs deep behind enemy lines. But not everything is in your control. Dangerous space phenomena like particle storms and asteroid fields will test even senior commanders.  Attack head-on, with a clever flank, or even from above and below your foes. Homeworld 3\u2019s fully simulated ballistics make line of sight and cover critical strategic considerations. Your fleet persists from mission to mission. Scars on your ships linger. Strike craft pilots and capital ship captains pass along critical information through battlefield chatter.  Homeworld\u2019s timeless art style evolves with modern technology, offering an incredible sense of scale, destruction, and wonder. Strike craft fly in formation between hulking Battlecruisers against a backdrop of stars and nebulae. Iconic ships cast silhouettes over the remains of ancient civilizations. Explosions ripple and erupt across hulls as one fleet stakes its victory over another. Homeworld\u2019s game-of-the-year winning story continues. Since the end of Homeworld 2, the galaxy enjoyed an age of abundance thanks to the Hyperspace Gate Network. Cycles of plenty and war have come and gone. Now the gates themselves are catastrophically failing and Karan, who has passed into myth and religious idolatry, is the key to the mystery threatening a galaxy\u2019s future.  War Games, the all-new three player co-op mode extends your game beyond the campaign. Fusing Homeworld\u2019s RTS gameplay with roguelike inspiration, commanders take on a randomized series of fleet combat challenges. Claim powerful Artifacts that augment your ships with more power, speed, and, of course, weapons. Based on your results, you\u2019ll unlock new fleets to shake up your strategy. Your ultimate test of tactical skill comes in battle against human opponents. Sharpen your instincts in AI skirmish matches, before squaring off with human opponents in 1v1, free-for-all, or team battles. Mods allow players to craft their own content for Homeworld 3 and share it with players around the world. From rebuilding maps with megaliths, to augmenting ships, the Unreal game editor is at your fingertips. If direct creation isn\u2019t your thing, enjoy the creativity of the community by downloading mods hassle-free through in-game mod.io integration."

Lossless Scaling is also useful for upscaling modern games if you cannot run them at native screen resolution (GPU limited) and want to get rid of blur due to bilinear scaling of the GPU driver, as well as for upscaling older and pixel-art games which do not support modern screen resolutions or full screen mode. For modern games it is best to use LS1 or AMD FSR. For scaling pixel-art games, use Integer Scaling or xBR. Anime4K is best suited for cartoons or anime.  Requirements: Scaling makes sense when you are limited by GPU power. For the best experience, limit the game to a stable frame rate so that Lossless Scaling has resources to work with.

    "description": "GOOD NEWS EVERYONE : By purchasing the game, you actually get two games now: 1) The original The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, 2) The Unreal Engine 4 remaster called The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux. Please see this link for details. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won\u2019t be able to see them. You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan\u2019s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into. Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters. Still, the discoveries won\u2019t happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Paul\u2019s supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy. Key Features  Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley , which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments.  Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues  that help you piece together the truth behind Ethan\u2019s disappearance -- and the fate of his family.  Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction , all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft.  Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace . Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease."
